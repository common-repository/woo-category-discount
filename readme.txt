Category Discounts provides an excellent feature by allowing you to decide when you want to provide the discount. By default, the plugin provides the discount for current purchase. However, you can also provide the discount to your customers for next purchase, i.e. if you are going to give $20 discount to your customer for current purchase that instead of providing the discount, give them a coupon which can be used for next purchase. Check out video to learn how to configure the plugin to do so.
